\usage{
players_drop(h2h_mat, ...)

fill_h2h(h2h_mat, fill = NA_real_, ...)

\method{print}{h2h}(x, ...)

get_cr_players(cr_data, players = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{h2h_mat}{Head-to-Head matrix.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to or from methods.}

\item{fill}{Value to fill with.}

\item{x}{Value to print.}

\item{cr_data}{Competition results.}

\item{players}{Vector of players for which Head-to-Head is computed.}
}
\value{
\code{players_drop()} removes from \code{h2h_mat} rows and columns of the
players for which either row or column contain only \code{NA} (in most cases it
means these players are absent in original competition results).

\code{fill_h2h()} replaces \code{NA}s in \code{h2h_mat} with \code{fill}.

\code{get_cr_players()} in case of argument \code{players} is \code{NULL} returns vector of
players present in \code{cr_data}. If not \code{NULL} then returns its argument
\code{players}.

\code{get_matchups()} returns a \link[tibble:tibble]{tibble} of all
matchups (pairs of players from one game) present in \code{cr_data}. It has
following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{game} - game identifier of matchup.
\item \code{player1} - identifier of first player in matchup.
\item \code{score1} - score of the first player in matchup.
\item \code{player2} - identifier of second player in matchup.
\item \code{score2} - score of the second player in matchup.
}

\strong{Note} that matchups are not symmetrical: matchup "player1"-"player2"
is considered different from "player2"-"player1" in order to except more
advanced, not symmetrical Head-to-Head values.
