#' Compute Head-to-Head matrix
#'
#' This page describes methods of computing Head-to-Head matrices.
#'
#' @param cr_data Competition results in format ready for [as_longcr()].
#' @param h2h_fun Head-to-Head function (see Details).
#' @param players Vector of players for which Head-to-Head is computed.
#' @param absent_players Function which performs actions on Head-to-Head matrix
#'   dealing with players which absent in `cr_data`.
#' @param absent_h2h Function which performs actions on Head-to-Head matrix
#'   dealing with absent Head-to-Head records for some pairs of players.
#' @param transpose Whether to transpose Head-to-Head matrix.
#' @param self_play Values for self-play matchups.
#' @param ... Additional arguments to be passed to or from methods.
#'
#' @details Head-to-Head value is a measure of a quality of direct
#' confrontation between two players. It is assumed that this value can be
#' computed based only on the players' scores in their common games. If it is
#' not true for some case then competition results should be changed by
#' transformation or addition of more information (in form of extra columns or
#' extra field in `score` column(s) making list-column(s)).
#'
#' `get_h2h()` performs computation of Head-to-Head matrix: square matrix with
#' number of rows (and columns) equal to number of players for which it is
#' computed. Head-to-Head values are computed based only on
#' [matchups][head-to-head-helpers] (pairs of players from one game) between
#' players from argument `players`. __Note__ to be careful with Head-to-Head
#' values of players with themselves: it can be inaccurate if `players` is not
#' `NULL` because it will be based on possibly undesirable data.
#'
#' The following algorithm is used:
#' 1. Compute for every present in `cr_data` matchup between players from
#' `players` its Head-to-Head value via `h2h_fun` based on these players'
#' scores in common games. `h2h_fun` should accept two arguments:
#'     - A tibble of [matchups][head-to-head-helpers] data. Structure is like
#'     [widecr][results-widecr] with two players, i.e. with columns `game`,
#'     `player1`, `score1`, `player2`, `score2` (in input of `h2h_fun()` columns
#'     `player1` and `player2` will contain constant values).
#'     - Argument `...` for easier use of `get_h2h()`.
#' Also `h2h_fun` should return a single value.
#' __Note__ that order of the players in matchups matters. So, for example,
#' matchup "player1"-"player2" is considered different from "player2"-"player1"
#' in order to except not symmetrical Head-to-Head values.
#' For absent in `cr_data` matchups `NA_real_`s are produced.
#'
#' 1. Perform actions via `absent_players`. It should, based on Head-to-Head
#' matrix, do something with data of players that have not enough games played.
#' For no actions use [skip_action()]. For other options see [Head-to-Head
#' helpers][head-to-head-helpers].
#'
#' 1. Perform actions via `absent_h2h`. It should do something with those
#' entries of Head-to-Head matrix which are `NA`. For no actions use
#' [skip_action()]. For other options see [Head-to-Head
#' helpers][head-to-head-helpers].
#'
#' 1. If `transpose` is `TRUE` do transposition of Head-to-Head matrix. This
#' option is added to minimize the need in almost duplicated `h2h_fun`s.
#'
#' 1. If `self_play` is not `NULL` replace values on diagonal of Head-to-Head
#' matrix with `self_play`.
#'
#' If argument `players` is `NULL` then Head-to-Head matrix is computed for all
#' present in `cr_data` players. __Note__ that `players` can contain values that
#' are not present in `cr_data`: in this case rows and columns in Head-to-Head
#' matrix for these values will contain only `NA`s (before applying
#' `absent_players`).
#'
#' @return An object of class `h2h` which is a square matrix of Head-to-Head
#'   values. Rows correspond to `player1` and columns to `player2` (as in input
#'   for `h2h_fun`). Row and column names are made with `as.character()` on
#'   players used for computation.
